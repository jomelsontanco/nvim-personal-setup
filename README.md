# nvim-personal-setup

This is my personal Neovim setup.
Serves as a backup of my configuration for synching across computers.

## Windows

Put all the files of this repository under %AppData%\Local\nvim.
If it's a new neovim setup, create the nvim folder if it doesn't exist yet.
AppData is a hidden file.
